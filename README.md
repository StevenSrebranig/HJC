The Hoffman–Joyce Continuum (HJC)

A Structural Specification for Textual Modulation

Specification Version 6.0 — Canonical Repository

Overview

The Hoffman–Joyce Continuum (HJC) is a formal specification for modulating reader perception through language while preserving explicit epistemic boundaries. It models how rhythm, syntax, sequencing, and controlled ambiguity shape perceptual state—without altering the truth status of claims.

HJC treats language as a perceptual interface, not merely a carrier of information. However, unlike purely aesthetic or rhetorical theories, HJC operates under a declared Lucid Substrate: all modulation occurs atop clearly stated claims, inferences, and non-claims.

This repository contains the canonical specification of HJC.

What HJC Is (and Is Not)

HJC is:

A constraint-based specification governing perceptual modulation in text

Applicable to writing, analysis, translation, pedagogy, oratory, and AI-assisted transformation

Designed for auditability, reversibility, and structural inspection

HJC is not:

A persuasion framework

A belief-generation system

A method for smuggling claims through affect

A replacement for evidence, argument, or judgment

HJC modulates how a text is experienced, not what the text is allowed to assert.

Core Axes of Modulation

HJC models modulation along three orthogonal axes:

Fit — coherence, lucidity, structural grounding

Phase — oscillation, hinge, inversion, rhythmic reorientation

Dissolution — controlled ambiguity, drift, micro-decoherence

Texts move along the lucid–dream continuum through deliberate redistribution of these axes.

Epistemic Boundary (v6.0)

Version 6.0 formalizes a strict boundary:

HJC may shape perception, but must not silently rewrite epistemic status.

Key constructs introduced or clarified in v6.0 include:

Lucid Substrate

Non-Claims

Recoverability

Premature Dissolution Injection (PDI)

Self-Sealing Structures

Structural Correction Failure

These constraints make HJC suitable for high-stakes contexts (education, analysis, public discourse) without collapsing into manipulation.

Relation to Specification-Driven Intelligence (SDI)

HJC is a concrete instantiation of Specification-Driven Intelligence (SDI).

Under SDI:

The human-authored specification defines intent and constraints

AI systems act only as interpreters, not authors

Authority resides in the specification; responsibility remains human

HJC functions as executable constraint logic when paired with an AI interpreter.
